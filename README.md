Overview:- 
This project involves developing an interactive Olympic dashboard in Power BI, designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of Olympic Games data. The dashboard leverages filters, slicers, and KPIs to deliver a tailored and dynamic user experience, allowing users to explore Olympic data with precision and ease.

Medal Distribution Analysis:-
Filters and Slicers: Users can filter data by year, country, sport, and event type using intuitive slicers. This allows for detailed exploration of medal distributions across different categories.
KPI Indicators: Highlight top-performing countries and athletes with dynamic KPIs that update based on user selections, showcasing the highest medal counts and standout performances.

Athlete Performance:-
Slicers for Detailed Views: Easily narrow down data to specific athletes, sports, or years using slicers, providing a focused analysis of individual performance trends.
Performance KPIs: Track key performance indicators such as the number of medals won, personal bests, and world records, offering a clear view of athlete achievements.
Achievement Timeline: An interactive timeline visual lets users track the career progress and milestones of individual athletes, with KPIs reflecting their peak performances and record-breaking moments

Custom Slicers:-
Slicers for medal types (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and specific Olympics editions provide a customized view, enabling users to focus on particular areas of interest.

Country Performance Dashboard:-
Real-Time Comparison Charts: Compare countries using side-by-side bar charts and line graphs, with filters for selecting specific Olympic Games, sports, or regions. KPIs dynamically adjust to highlight top performers, emerging nations, and historical powerhouses.
Slicer-Driven Insights: Apply multiple slicers to view how different factors like GDP, population, and investment in sports correlate with Olympic success. The dashboard provides actionable insights, linking national attributes to performance outcomes.

Olympic Evolution & Trends:-
Trend Analysis with Slicers: Track the evolution of the Olympics using trend lines and heatmaps. Users can apply slicers to examine specific eras, sports, or geopolitical contexts, with KPIs summarizing key developments like the introduction of new sports or shifts in global participation.
Interactive Data Storytelling: Engage with a narrative-driven view of the Olympic Games, where key moments in history are highlighted through visual storytelling. KPIs help quantify the impact of significant events, such as boycotts or the inclusion of new nations.
